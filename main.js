REMAINING CARD COUNTER ♥️♠️♦️♣️
Instructions:
- A deck of cards has 4 cards of each value (4 Aces, 4 Jacks... etc.)
- The input is a string of the chosen cards' values ("6,7,8,A")

- Write a program that returns the remaining cards, giving the face value and how many cards of that type remain

- For example, the return of remainingCards("6,7,8,A") should return "2:4,3:4,4:4,5:4,6:3,7:3,8:3,9:4,10:4,J:4,Q:4,K:4,A:3"
- ^ Card values of 6, 7, 8, A are now equal to 3

- Account for edge cases and if nobody is willing to play, tell them to "Go home and come back later with cash" ;) 

have fun
